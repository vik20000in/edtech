            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>No, It will be very difficult to understand a map which does not use conventional signs and symbols. Maps make use of different signs, symbols and colours to provide distinct information. And it ensures that the information is presented in a clear and concise manner with minimal scope of misinterpretation.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Topographic maps are maps which give detailed information about local features of small areas on the surface of the earth, including landforms, streams, rivers, canals, and other features. These maps are based on an accurate survey of land.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Plan: A plan is a drawing that shows the horizontal section of a small area or building. It is drawn to scale. It tells us exactly where things are on the ground. It is an accurate representation of an area. Sketch: A sketch is a rough drawing showing the relative locations of a few chosen features of an area. It is not drawn to scale. It does not show the true shape or size of the features. It is a rough representation of an area.</p>

                <h3>Q: What is a map? What are the different types of maps based on scale?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>A map is a drawing of the whole earth or a part of it on a flat surface. Based on scale, maps can be: Small-scale maps (show a large land area in a small space, e.g., 1 cm = 200 km, less detail) and Large-scale maps (show smaller area of land in bigger space, e.g., 1 cm = 1 km, more detail).</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Political maps show the boundaries of countries, states, etc., and also the location of capital cities and important towns. Physical maps show mountains, valleys, plains, rivers, and other surface features, often using different colours to represent land of different heights.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Advantages: It is the most accurate three-dimensional representation of the earth. It shows the distribution of continents and oceans accurately. Lines of latitude and longitude are marked. Disadvantages: Only a part of the earth can be seen at one glance. All details cannot be marked. A globe is difficult to carry around.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The directions—North, South, East and West—are called the cardinal directions. Conventionally, the top portion of the map is taken as the North and the bottom, right and left of the map as the South, the East and the West respectively.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The scale of a map is the ratio or proportion between the distance shown on the map and the actual distance on the ground. It helps us to find out the correct distance between various points on a map.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>A scale can be expressed in three ways: 1. By a statement (verbal scale, e.g., 1 cm = 5 km). 2. By representative fraction (R.F., e.g., 1:50,000). 3. By a linear scale or graph (graphic scale).</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>A legend or key is an essential feature of any map. It explains the colours, signs, and symbols used in the map. It is usually provided near the top or the bottom of the map.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The five essential features (elements) of a map are: 1. Title (indicates the subject of the map). 2. Scale (denotes the relationship between map distance and ground distance). 3. Direction (usually indicated by a north line or assumed with North at the top). 4. Key or Legend (explains the symbols used). 5. Grid system (network of latitudes and longitudes for locating places).</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The north line helps determine direction on the map. The legend or key explains the meaning of the various colours, signs, and symbols used on the map, making it understandable.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The four major directions (North, South, East, West) are called cardinal directions. The directions in between these cardinal directions (e.g., North-East, South-West, North-North-East) are called intermediate directions.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Two ways are: (a) Verbal or statement scale: The scale is stated in words, like "1 cm = 5 km". (b) Representative Fraction (R.F.): Expressed as a ratio where the numerator (usually 1) is the map distance and the denominator is the ground distance in the same units, like 1:50,000 (meaning 1 cm on map = 50,000 cm on ground).</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The key or legend is important because it explains the meaning of the symbols, signs, and colours used on the map, allowing the user to understand the information presented.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Colours make maps attractive and easier to understand and interpret. Conventionally, different colours represent different features on physical maps: Blue for water bodies, Green for lowlands/plains, Brown for hills/mountains/plateaux, Yellow for hot deserts, and White for cold deserts/snow-covered regions.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The grid system is a network of horizontal lines (latitudes) and vertical lines (longitudes) drawn on a map or globe. It is important because it helps in accurately locating places on the surface of the earth by finding the intersection of a place's latitude and longitude.</p>
