    <h1>Inside Our Earth - Questions and Answers</h1>
    
    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q1: What are the three layers of the earth?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Crust, Mantle, and Core.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q2: What is the crust?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The uppermost layer over the earth's surface is called the crust. It is the thinnest of all layers.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q3: What are the main mineral constituents of the continental mass?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Silica and Alumina. It is thus called 'sial' (si-silica and al-alumina).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q4: What are the main mineral constituents of the oceanic crust?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Silica and Magnesium. It is therefore called 'sima' (si-silica and ma-magnesium).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q5: What is the mantle?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The layer just beneath the crust is the mantle. It extends up to a depth of 2900 km.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q6: What is the core?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The innermost layer of the earth is the core, with a radius of about 3500 km. It is mainly made of Nickel and Iron ('nife').</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q7: What is a rock?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Any natural mass of mineral matter that makes up the earth's crust is called a rock.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q8: Name the three types of rocks.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Igneous rocks, Sedimentary rocks, and Metamorphic rocks.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q9: How are igneous rocks formed?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: When molten magma cools and becomes solid, igneous rocks are formed. They are also called primary rocks.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q10: Differentiate between intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Extrusive rocks are formed when molten lava comes on the earth's surface and cools rapidly (e.g., Basalt). Intrusive rocks are formed when magma cools deep inside the earth's crust (e.g., Granite).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q11: How are sedimentary rocks formed?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Rocks roll down, crack, and hit each other to break into small fragments called sediments. These sediments are transported by wind/water and compressed to form sedimentary rocks (e.g., Sandstone).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q12: How are metamorphic rocks formed?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Igneous and sedimentary rocks can change into metamorphic rocks under great heat and pressure (e.g., Clay into Slate, Limestone into Marble).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q13: What is the rock cycle?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The process of transformation of the rock from one to another under certain conditions in a cyclic manner is known as the rock cycle.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q14: What are minerals?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Minerals are naturally occurring substances which have certain physical properties and definite chemical composition.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q15: Why is the core very hot?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The core is under immense pressure and contains radioactive elements, making it extremely hot.</div>
