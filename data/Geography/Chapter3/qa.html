    <h1>Our Changing Earth - Questions and Answers</h1>
    
    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q1: What are lithospheric plates?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The lithosphere is broken into a number of plates known as lithospheric plates. These plates move around very slowly.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q2: Why do lithospheric plates move?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: They move because of the movement of the molten magma inside the earth.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q3: Differentiate between endogenic and exogenic forces.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Endogenic forces act in the interior of the earth (e.g., Earthquakes, Volcanoes). Exogenic forces work on the surface of the earth (e.g., Wind, Water).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q4: What is a volcano?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A volcano is a vent (opening) in the earth's crust through which molten material erupts suddenly.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q5: What is an earthquake?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The vibration of the earth's surface caused by the sudden movement of lithospheric plates is called an earthquake.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q6: What is the focus and epicentre?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The place in the crust where the movement starts is called the focus. The place on the surface above the focus is called the epicentre.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q7: How is an earthquake measured?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: An earthquake is measured with a machine called a seismograph. The magnitude is measured on the Richter scale.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q8: What is weathering?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Weathering is the breaking up of the rocks on the earth's surface.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q9: What is erosion?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Erosion is the wearing away of the landscape by different agents like water, wind, and ice.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q10: How are waterfalls formed?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: When a river tumbles at a steep angle over very hard rocks or down a steep valley side, it forms a waterfall.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q11: What are meanders?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: As the river enters the plain, it twists and turns forming large bends known as meanders.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q12: What is an ox-bow lake?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Due to continuous erosion and deposition along the sides of the meander, the ends of the meander loop come closer and eventually cut off from the river forming a cut-off lake, called an ox-bow lake.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q13: What are sand dunes?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: When the wind blows, it lifts and transports sand. When it stops blowing, the sand falls and gets deposited in low hill-like structures called sand dunes.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q14: What is a delta?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A triangular landform formed at the mouth of a river where it deposits sediments before entering the sea is called a delta.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q15: What are glacial moraines?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The material carried by the glacier such as rocks, sand, and silt gets deposited to form glacial moraines.</div>
