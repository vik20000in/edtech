    <h1>The Leaf - Questions and Answers</h1>
    
    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q1: What is a leaf?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A leaf is a flattened, green, lateral outgrowth of the stem of a vascular plant. It is the primary site of photosynthesis.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q2: What are the main parts of a leaf?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The main parts of a leaf are the leaf base, petiole (stalk), and lamina (leaf blade).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q3: What is photosynthesis?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants make their own food using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water in the presence of chlorophyll.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q4: What is chlorophyll?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Chlorophyll is the green pigment present in leaves that traps sunlight energy for photosynthesis.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q5: What are stomata?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Stomata are tiny pores present on the surface of leaves (mostly on the underside) that help in the exchange of gases and transpiration.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q6: What is transpiration?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The loss of excess water in the form of water vapour from the aerial parts of the plant (mainly leaves) is called transpiration.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q7: Differentiate between simple and compound leaves.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A simple leaf has a single undivided blade (e.g., Mango). A compound leaf has the blade divided into smaller leaflets (e.g., Rose).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q8: What is venation? Types?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The arrangement of veins and veinlets in the leaf lamina is called venation. Two types: Reticulate (net-like) and Parallel.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q9: What is the function of veins in a leaf?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Veins transport water, minerals, and food to and from the leaf. They also provide structural support to the leaf blade.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q10: What is a tendril?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A tendril is a modified leaf or stem used by climbing plants for support and attachment. Example: Pea plant leaf tendrils.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q11: What are spines?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Spines are modified leaves found in desert plants (like Cactus) to reduce water loss by transpiration and protect the plant from grazing animals.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q12: What is vegetative propagation by leaves?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Some plants like Bryophyllum can reproduce through their leaves. New plants grow from the buds present on the leaf margins.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q13: Why are leaves called the 'Kitchen of the Plant'?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Leaves are called the kitchen of the plant because they prepare food for the entire plant through photosynthesis.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q14: What is the petiole?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The stalk that attaches the leaf blade to the stem is called the petiole.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q15: What is the midrib?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The thick vein running through the centre of the leaf is called the midrib.</div>
