        <div class="answer">
          <p>The root serves the following functions:<br> 1. It fixes the plant in the soil[cite: 19].<br> 2. Absorbs water and minerals from the soil for the entire plant[cite: 20].<br> 3. It acts as a storage part for food materials for certain plants[cite: 21].<br> 4. It binds the soil together so that it does not get washed away during rain or blown over by the wind[cite: 22].</p>

          <h3>Q: Mention the functions of the following: (i) Spines (ii) Tendril (iii) Scale leaves</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>(i) <strong>Spines:</strong> The leaves may be modified to form spines to reduce water loss by transpiration in desert plants (like cactus) or bear spines on the margin (like prickly poppy)[cite: 23, 46, 67].<br> (ii) <strong>Tendril:</strong> The stem or leaf/leaflet may occur as a thread-like, leafless, wiry, coiled structure called a tendril. It is sensitive to touch and coils around objects to help the plant climb[cite: 24, 25, 65, 66, 72]. E.g., Sweet pea[cite: 67, 73].<br> (iii) <strong>Scale leaves:</strong> Scale leaves are present in some plants like onion and ginger. They can be thin and dry or thick and fleshy, and their function is to protect buds[cite: 25, 26, 68, 69].</p>

        <div class="answer">
          <p><strong>Venation:</strong> Arrangement or pattern of veins in a lamina is called venation[cite: 28].<br>It is mainly of two types[cite: 29]:<br> 1. <strong>Reticulate venation:</strong> Veins and veinlets are irregularly distributed in the lamina forming a network[cite: 29]. Example: mango, guava[cite: 30].<br> 2. <strong>Parallel venation:</strong> Veins run parallel to each other[cite: 30]. Example: Banana, grass, wheat[cite: 30].</p>

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p><strong>Modification of leaves in Venus flytrap (an insectivorous plant):</strong><br>The leaves of Venus flytrap have long pointed hair[cite: 31]. It is divided into two parts with a midrib in between like a hinge[cite: 32]. When an insect visits the leaf, it closes its two parts and traps the insect[cite: 33]. The insect is then digested by secreting digestive juices[cite: 34].</p>

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The two main functions of leaves are:<br> 1. <strong>Photosynthesis:</strong> Green leaves contain chlorophyll which, in the presence of sunlight, manufactures food using carbon dioxide and water[cite: 35, 48].<br> 2. <strong>Transpiration:</strong> The surface of leaves has minute pores which help in the loss of water by evaporation[cite: 36, 48]. It has a cooling effect and causes suction, making roots absorb more water[cite: 37].</p>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>1. Bryophyllum is a plant whose leaves produce adventitious buds in their margin[cite: 39].<br> 2. The adventitious buds grow into new plants when they fall off from the parent plant[cite: 40].</p>

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>(i) <strong>Photosynthesis:</strong> The process by which a plant leaf prepares or synthesises food from water and carbon dioxide in the presence of chlorophyll and sunlight is called photosynthesis[cite: 41].<br> (ii) <strong>Transpiration:</strong> This is the process by which there is a loss of water in the form of vapour by evaporation from the surface of leaves[cite: 42]. It has a cooling effect and causes a suction force to make roots absorb more water with mineral ions[cite: 43].</p>
