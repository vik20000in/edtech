    <h1>The Cell - Questions and Answers</h1>
    
    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q1: What is a cell?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A cell is the structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q2: Who discovered the cell?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Robert Hooke discovered the cell in 1665.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q3: What are the three main parts of a cell?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The three main parts are the Cell Membrane, Cytoplasm, and Nucleus.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q4: What is the function of the nucleus?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The nucleus controls all the activities of the cell. It contains genetic material (DNA).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q5: What is the cell membrane?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The cell membrane is the outer protective covering of the cell. It controls the entry and exit of substances.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q6: Differentiate between plant and animal cells.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Plant cells have a cell wall and chloroplasts, which are absent in animal cells. Animal cells have centrioles, which are absent in plant cells. Plant cells usually have a large central vacuole.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q7: What is the function of mitochondria?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Mitochondria are called the 'Powerhouse of the cell' because they produce energy through respiration.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q8: What are chloroplasts?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Chloroplasts are green plastids found in plant cells that contain chlorophyll and help in photosynthesis.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q9: What is the function of the cell wall?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The cell wall provides rigidity, shape, and protection to the plant cell. It is made of cellulose.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q10: What is cytoplasm?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Cytoplasm is the jelly-like substance present between the cell membrane and the nucleus. It contains cell organelles.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q11: What are unicellular and multicellular organisms?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Unicellular organisms are made of a single cell (e.g., Amoeba). Multicellular organisms are made of many cells (e.g., Humans).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q12: What are chromosomes?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Chromosomes are thread-like structures present in the nucleus that carry genes and transfer characteristics from parents to offspring.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q13: What is a tissue?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A group of similar cells performing a specific function is called a tissue.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q14: What are vacuoles?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Vacuoles are sac-like structures used for storing food, water, and waste. They are large in plant cells and small or absent in animal cells.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q15: Why is the nucleus called the brain of the cell?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Because it regulates and coordinates all the vital activities of the cell.</div>
