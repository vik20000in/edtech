    <h1>Matter - Questions and Answers</h1>
    
    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q1: What is matter?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Anything that has mass and occupies space is called matter.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q2: What are the three states of matter?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Solid, Liquid, and Gas.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q3: What is an atom?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: An atom is the smallest particle of an element that can exist and retains the properties of that element.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q4: What is a molecule?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A molecule is the smallest particle of a substance (element or compound) that can exist independently and retains the properties of that substance.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q5: Define intermolecular force.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The force of attraction between the molecules of a substance is called intermolecular force.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q6: Define intermolecular space.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The space between the molecules of a substance is called intermolecular space.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q7: Why do solids have a fixed shape and volume?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Because the molecules in solids are very tightly packed, have strong intermolecular forces, and very little intermolecular space.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q8: Why do liquids flow?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: In liquids, the molecules are less tightly packed than in solids and can move around each other, allowing liquids to flow.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q9: Why do gases fill the entire container?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: In gases, the intermolecular force is negligible, and molecules move freely in all directions, filling the entire available space.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q10: What is diffusion?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The intermixing of particles of two different substances on their own is called diffusion.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q11: What is Brownian motion?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The zig-zag movement of small particles suspended in a liquid or gas is called Brownian motion.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q12: Can matter change its state?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Yes, matter can change its state on heating or cooling (e.g., Ice to Water to Steam).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q13: What is melting point?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The fixed temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid is called its melting point.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q14: What is boiling point?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The fixed temperature at which a liquid starts boiling and changes into gas is called its boiling point.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q15: What is sublimation?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The process in which a solid directly changes into gas without becoming liquid on heating is called sublimation (e.g., Camphor, Naphthalene).</div>
