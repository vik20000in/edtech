            <div class="answer">
                <p>Matter is defined as anything which occupies space and has mass[cite: 1, 38]. It can be perceived by our senses[cite: 39].</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">

            </div>
            <div class="answer">

            <div class="answer">
                <p>The forces acting between the molecules which hold them together in a substance are called the inter-molecular forces[cite: 6]. It is the force of attraction between molecules[cite: 55].</p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Characteristics of molecules: 1. They are very small in size[cite: 61]. 2. They have spaces between them[cite: 62]. 3. They are in constant random motion[cite: 62]. 4. They always attract each other[cite: 62].</p>

                <h3>Q: How do molecules move in solids, liquids, and gases?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>In solids, molecules vibrate to and fro about their mean positions but do not leave their positions[cite: 11, 12, 85]. In liquids, molecules are free to move within the boundary of the liquid[cite: 13]. In gases, molecules are free to move anywhere in space[cite: 14]. The molecular motion in liquid and gas follows a zig-zag path[cite: 25, 68].</p>

             <div class="question">
                 <h3>Q: Why does a solid have a definite shape and volume?</h3>
             </div>
             <div class="answer">
                 <p>In a solid, molecules are very tightly packed with high inter-molecular force[cite: 84]. The molecules do not move from their mean position, only vibrate, thus solids have a definite shape and volume[cite: 85].</p>

                 <h3>Q: Why does a liquid have a definite volume but no definite shape?</h3>
             </div>
            <div class="answer">
                 <p>In liquids, molecules are less tightly packed than solids with weaker inter-molecular forces[cite: 88, 96]. Molecules can move within the liquid[cite: 88]. Thus, they acquire the shape of the vessel but have a definite volume at a given temperature[cite: 89, 98].</p>

                <h3>Q: Why does a gas have neither a definite shape nor a definite volume?</h3>
            </div>
             <div class="answer">
                <p>In gases, molecules are far apart with the weakest inter-molecular forces[cite: 91, 99]. Molecules are not bound and move about freely, so gases have neither a definite shape nor a definite volume[cite: 92, 100].</p>

             </div>
             <div class="answer">
                 <p>The change in state of matter of a substance, such as from solid to liquid or liquid to gas, brought about by imparting heat energy at a constant temperature[cite: 104].</p>

             </div>
             <div class="answer">
                 <p>It is the process of change of a substance from solid state into its liquid state on absorption of heat at a particular constant temperature, called the melting point[cite: 105].</p>

                 <p>It is the process of change of a substance from a liquid state to its gaseous state at a particular constant temperature, called the boiling point[cite: 106].</p>
