    <h1>Force - Questions and Answers</h1>
    
    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q1: Define force.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Force is a push or pull acting on an object which changes or tends to change the state of rest or of motion of the object.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q2: What is the SI unit of force?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The SI unit of force is the Newton (N).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q3: What are the effects of force?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Force can move a stationary object, stop a moving object, change the speed or direction of a moving object, and change the shape or size of an object.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q4: Differentiate between contact and non-contact forces.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Contact forces act only when objects are in physical contact (e.g., friction, muscular force). Non-contact forces act from a distance without physical contact (e.g., gravitational force, magnetic force).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q5: What is friction?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It acts in the direction opposite to the motion.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q6: What is gravitational force?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The force of attraction with which the earth pulls everything towards its centre is called gravitational force or gravity.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q7: What is electrostatic force?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The force exerted by a charged body on another charged or uncharged body is called electrostatic force.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q8: What is magnetic force?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The force exerted by a magnet on magnetic materials (like iron) or other magnets is called magnetic force.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q9: Why is friction called a necessary evil?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Friction is necessary because it helps us walk, write, and stop vehicles. It is an evil because it causes wear and tear of machine parts and wastes energy as heat.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q10: How can friction be reduced?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Friction can be reduced by using lubricants (oil, grease), using ball bearings, polishing surfaces, and streamlining the shape of objects.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q11: How can friction be increased?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Friction can be increased by making surfaces rough, such as the treads on tyres or the soles of shoes.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q12: What is muscular force?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The force exerted by the muscles of our body is called muscular force. It is a contact force.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q13: Define 1 Newton.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: 1 Newton is the force required to lift a mass of approximately 100g (0.1 kg) vertically upwards.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q14: What is a spring balance used for?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A spring balance is a device used to measure the force acting on an object, often used to measure weight.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q15: Does force always produce motion?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: No, force does not always produce motion. For example, pushing a heavy wall applies force but does not move the wall.</div>
