    <h1>Light - Questions and Answers</h1>
    
    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q1: What is rectilinear propagation of light?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The property of light travelling in a straight line is called rectilinear propagation of light.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q2: What is a shadow?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A shadow is a dark region formed behind an opaque object when it blocks the path of light.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q3: Differentiate between transparent, translucent, and opaque objects.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Transparent objects allow light to pass through them completely (e.g., glass). Translucent objects allow only some light to pass through (e.g., butter paper). Opaque objects do not allow light to pass through at all (e.g., wood).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q4: What is reflection of light?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The bouncing back of light rays when they fall on a smooth, polished surface is called reflection of light.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q5: What is a solar eclipse?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A solar eclipse occurs when the moon comes between the sun and the earth, casting its shadow on the earth. It happens only on a new moon day.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q6: What is a lunar eclipse?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A lunar eclipse occurs when the earth comes between the sun and the moon, casting its shadow on the moon. It happens only on a full moon night.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q7: What are luminous and non-luminous objects?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Luminous objects emit their own light (e.g., Sun, candle). Non-luminous objects do not emit their own light but reflect light from other sources (e.g., Moon, table).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q8: What is a pinhole camera?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A pinhole camera is a simple device that forms an inverted image of an object on a screen. It works on the principle of rectilinear propagation of light.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q9: Define Umbra and Penumbra.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Umbra is the darkest central part of a shadow where no light reaches. Penumbra is the lighter outer part of a shadow where some light reaches.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q10: State the laws of reflection.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: 1. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. 2. The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q11: What is lateral inversion?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The phenomenon where the left side of an object appears as the right side in the image formed by a plane mirror is called lateral inversion.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q12: What is the speed of light?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 300,000 kilometres per second (3 × 10⁸ m/s).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q13: Why can't we see in the dark?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: We see objects when light reflects off them and enters our eyes. In the dark, there is no light to reflect, so we cannot see.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q14: What is a beam of light?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A collection of light rays is called a beam of light. It can be parallel, convergent, or divergent.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q15: What are the characteristics of an image formed by a plane mirror?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The image is virtual, erect, laterally inverted, of the same size as the object, and formed at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front.</div>
