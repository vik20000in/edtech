    <h1>Magnetism - Questions and Answers</h1>
    
    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q1: What is a magnet?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A magnet is a material that attracts magnetic substances like iron, nickel, and cobalt.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q2: What are the poles of a magnet?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The two ends of a magnet where the magnetic force is strongest are called its poles. They are the North Pole and the South Pole.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q3: State the law of magnetic poles.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Like poles repel each other, and unlike poles attract each other.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q4: What is a magnetic field?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The region around a magnet where its magnetic influence can be felt is called its magnetic field.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q5: How can you demagnetize a magnet?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A magnet can be demagnetized by heating, hammering, or dropping it repeatedly from a height.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q6: What is a magnetic compass?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A magnetic compass is a device with a magnetized needle that is free to rotate. It is used to find directions as the needle always points North-South.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q7: Differentiate between magnetic and non-magnetic substances.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Magnetic substances are attracted by a magnet (e.g., iron, steel). Non-magnetic substances are not attracted by a magnet (e.g., wood, plastic, copper).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q8: What is the directive property of a magnet?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A freely suspended magnet always comes to rest in the North-South direction. This is called the directive property of a magnet.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q9: What are natural and artificial magnets?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Natural magnets are found in nature (e.g., Lodestone or Magnetite). Artificial magnets are man-made from magnetic materials (e.g., Bar magnet, Horseshoe magnet).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q10: How can you make a temporary magnet?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A temporary magnet can be made by the 'Single Touch' method (stroking an iron bar with a magnet) or by passing electric current through a coil wrapped around an iron nail (Electromagnet).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q11: Why should magnets be stored with keepers?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Magnets should be stored with keepers (soft iron pieces) across their poles to prevent self-demagnetization and loss of magnetic strength over time.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q12: Can a magnet have only one pole?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: No, magnetic poles always exist in pairs. If you break a magnet, each piece will still have a North and a South pole.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q13: What is an electromagnet?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: An electromagnet is a temporary magnet made by passing electric current through a coil of wire wound around a soft iron core. It loses its magnetism when the current is switched off.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q14: Where are electromagnets used?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Electromagnets are used in electric bells, cranes to lift heavy iron loads, loudspeakers, and MRI machines.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q15: What is the surest test for magnetism?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Repulsion is the surest test for magnetism because attraction can occur between a magnet and an unmagnetized magnetic substance, but repulsion only occurs between two like poles of magnets.</div>
