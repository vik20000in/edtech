    <h1>Simple Machines - Questions and Answers</h1>
    
    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q1: What is a simple machine?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A simple machine is a device that makes our work easier, faster, or changes the direction of force applied. Examples include lever, pulley, and inclined plane.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q2: What are the three classes of levers?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Class I (fulcrum between load and effort), Class II (load between fulcrum and effort), and Class III (effort between fulcrum and load).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q3: Give an example of a Class II lever.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A wheelbarrow, nutcracker, or bottle opener are examples of Class II levers.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q4: What is the mechanical advantage of a machine?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Mechanical advantage (MA) is the ratio of the load lifted to the effort applied. MA = Load / Effort.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q5: How does an inclined plane help in doing work?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: An inclined plane increases the distance over which the force is applied, thereby reducing the effort needed to lift a heavy load to a certain height.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q6: What is a pulley?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A pulley is a simple machine consisting of a wheel with a grooved rim over which a rope or chain passes. It is used to lift heavy loads.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q7: What is the advantage of using a single fixed pulley?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A single fixed pulley changes the direction of the effort applied (downwards instead of upwards), making it easier to lift a load. It does not multiply force.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q8: What is a wedge? Give examples.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A wedge is a double inclined plane used to cut or split objects. Examples include a knife, axe, and chisel.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q9: What is a screw?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder. It is used to hold things together or lift loads.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q10: What is a wheel and axle?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A wheel and axle consists of a large wheel attached to a smaller rod (axle). When the wheel turns, the axle also turns. Examples include a steering wheel and a screwdriver.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q11: Define Fulcrum, Load, and Effort.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Fulcrum (F) is the fixed point about which the lever turns. Load (L) is the object to be moved. Effort (E) is the force applied to move the load.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q12: Give examples of Class I levers.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Scissors, see-saw, and pliers are examples of Class I levers.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q13: Give examples of Class III levers.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Sugar tongs, fishing rod, and human forearm are examples of Class III levers.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q14: Why is a screw considered better than a nail?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A screw holds things together more tightly than a nail because of its threads, which grip the material firmly.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q15: How should we care for machines?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Machines should be kept clean, painted to prevent rust, and lubricated regularly to reduce friction and wear.</div>
