    <h1>Matter - Questions and Answers</h1>
    
    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q1: What is matter?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. It is made up of tiny particles called atoms and molecules.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q2: What are the three states of matter?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The three states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q3: Define intermolecular force.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The force of attraction between the molecules of a substance is called intermolecular force. It is strongest in solids and weakest in gases.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q4: What is intermolecular space?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The space between the molecules of a substance is called intermolecular space. It is minimum in solids and maximum in gases.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q5: Differentiate between solids and liquids based on shape and volume.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Solids have a fixed shape and a fixed volume. Liquids have a fixed volume but no fixed shape; they take the shape of the container.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q6: Why do gases not have a fixed shape or volume?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: In gases, the intermolecular force is negligible, and the intermolecular space is very large. The molecules are free to move in all directions, so they fill the entire space available to them.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q7: What is the kinetic theory of matter?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The kinetic theory of matter states that matter is made up of tiny particles that are in constant motion. The energy of motion is called kinetic energy, which increases with temperature.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q8: Define cohesion and adhesion.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Cohesion is the force of attraction between molecules of the same substance. Adhesion is the force of attraction between molecules of different substances.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q9: Why can a liquid flow?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Liquids can flow because their molecules are not as tightly packed as in solids and can slide over one another.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q10: What happens to the particles of a solid when it is heated?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: When a solid is heated, its particles gain kinetic energy and vibrate more vigorously. Eventually, they overcome the intermolecular forces and the solid melts into a liquid.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q11: Why are solids incompressible?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Solids are incompressible because their particles are closely packed with very little intermolecular space between them.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q12: Give two examples of fluids.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Liquids (like water, oil) and gases (like air, oxygen) are fluids because they can flow.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q13: Arrange solids, liquids, and gases in increasing order of intermolecular force.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Gas < Liquid < Solid.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q14: Arrange solids, liquids, and gases in increasing order of intermolecular space.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Solid < Liquid < Gas.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q15: What is Brownian motion?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The zig-zag, random motion of particles suspended in a fluid (liquid or gas) is called Brownian motion.</div>
