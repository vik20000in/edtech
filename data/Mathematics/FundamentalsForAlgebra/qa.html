                <h3>Q: Tick ( ) the appropriate answer: (i) What is the value of x in the equation 2x + 5 = 15? (a) 4 (b) 5 (c) 6 (d) 7</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The correct answer is (b) 5. Solving the equation: 2x + 5 = 15, subtract 5 from both sides to get 2x = 10, then divide by 2 to get x = 5.</p>
