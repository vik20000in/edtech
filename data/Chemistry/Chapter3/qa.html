    <h1>Matter - Questions and Answers</h1>
    
    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q1: Define matter.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q2: What are the three states of matter?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Solid, Liquid, and Gas.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q3: Why do solids have a fixed shape?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Solids have a fixed shape because the intermolecular forces of attraction are very strong, holding the particles tightly in fixed positions.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q4: What is diffusion?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The intermixing of particles of two different substances on their own is called diffusion. It is fastest in gases.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q5: Why can gases be compressed easily?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Gases can be compressed easily because there are large intermolecular spaces between their particles.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q6: What is melting point?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The constant temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid at atmospheric pressure is called its melting point.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q7: What is boiling point?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The constant temperature at which a liquid changes into a gas at atmospheric pressure is called its boiling point.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q8: Define condensation.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The process of changing a gas into a liquid on cooling is called condensation.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q9: What is freezing?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The process of changing a liquid into a solid on cooling is called freezing or solidification.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q10: Why does the smell of hot food reach us from a distance?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The particles of hot food have high kinetic energy and diffuse faster into the air, reaching us quickly.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q11: Differentiate between evaporation and boiling.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Evaporation is a surface phenomenon that occurs at any temperature below the boiling point. Boiling is a bulk phenomenon that occurs at a fixed temperature.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q12: What is the kinetic theory of matter?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: It states that matter is made of tiny particles which are in constant motion. The motion increases with temperature.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q13: Why do liquids take the shape of the container?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Liquids have weaker intermolecular forces than solids, allowing particles to slide over each other, so they take the shape of the container.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q14: What is sublimation? Give an example.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The change of state directly from solid to gas without changing into liquid is called sublimation. Example: Dry ice (solid CO₂).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q15: Arrange solid, liquid, gas in increasing order of particle motion.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Solid < Liquid < Gas.</div>
    </div>
