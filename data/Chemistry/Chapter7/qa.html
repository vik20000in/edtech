        <div class="question">Q1: What is a physical change?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A change in which no new substance is formed and the chemical properties remain the same is called a physical change. Example: Melting of ice.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q2: What is a chemical change?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A change in which one or more new substances are formed with entirely different properties is called a chemical change. Example: Burning of paper.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q3: Is rusting of iron a physical or chemical change?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Rusting of iron is a chemical change because a new substance (rust) is formed.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q4: What are the conditions necessary for rusting?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Presence of oxygen (air) and moisture (water) are necessary for rusting.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q5: How can rusting be prevented?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Rusting can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing, or galvanization.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q6: What is galvanization?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The process of depositing a layer of zinc on iron to prevent it from rusting is called galvanization.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q7: What is crystallization?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The process of obtaining large crystals of a pure substance from its solution is called crystallization. It is a physical change.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q8: Why is burning a candle both a physical and chemical change?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Melting of wax is a physical change, while burning of wax to produce heat and light is a chemical change.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q9: What happens when vinegar reacts with baking soda?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Carbon dioxide gas is produced with a hissing sound. This is a chemical change.</div>
