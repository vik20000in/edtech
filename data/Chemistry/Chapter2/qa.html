    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q1: What is an element?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: An element is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by any physical or chemical means. It is made of only one kind of atom.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q2: What is a compound?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A compound is a pure substance formed when two or more elements combine chemically in a fixed ratio by mass.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q3: What is a mixture?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A mixture is an impure substance formed when two or more substances are mixed together in any proportion without any chemical reaction.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q4: Give the symbol for Gold, Silver, and Iron.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Gold: Au, Silver: Ag, Iron: Fe.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q5: What is an atom?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: An atom is the smallest particle of an element that may or may not exist independently but takes part in a chemical reaction.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q6: What is a molecule?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A molecule is the smallest particle of an element or compound that can exist independently and retains the properties of that substance.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q7: Differentiate between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: A homogeneous mixture has a uniform composition throughout (e.g., salt solution). A heterogeneous mixture has a non-uniform composition (e.g., sand and water).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q8: What is atomicity?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: The number of atoms present in one molecule of an element is called its atomicity. For example, Oxygen (O₂) is diatomic.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q9: Write the chemical formula for Water and Carbon Dioxide.</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Water: H₂O, Carbon Dioxide: CO₂.</div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q10: Is air a mixture or a compound? Why?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Air is a mixture because its components (nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) retain their individual properties and can be separated by physical means. They are not chemically combined.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-container">
        <div class="question">Q11: What are metalloids?</div>
        <div class="answer">Ans: Elements that show properties of both metals and non-metals are called metalloids. Examples: Silicon, Germanium.</div>
    </div>
